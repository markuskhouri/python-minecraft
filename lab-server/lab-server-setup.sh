# This script sets up a lab server for hosting student environments
# for the python-minecraft code group.
#
# It is intended to be used as a provisioning script by Vagrant.  The
# provided Vagrantfile invokes this script after creating a vanilla
# box running Ubuntu Trusty (14.04 LTS) as its base image.
#
# The resulting box will have:
#
#  * Docker installed. Docker is used for hosting the student
#    environments. You will need to pull in a student image from a
#    Docker registry, or follow the instructions in the
#    :file:`student-env-image` folder to build one locally.
#
#  * The Lab Server Controller and its pre-dependencies will be
#    installed.
#
#  * The :command:`mcrcon` command will be compiled from source and
#    installed so that the Lab Server Controller can send commands to
#    the running Minecraft server instances.

Congratulations! You now have a Vagrant box that is ready to host lab
environments for students to use for the CoderDojo exercises!

First, connect to the server with:

    vagrant ssh

Change into the /vagrant folder, and consult the README.rst:

    less README.rst
